Open source mobile app to control hearing aids.

## what it do

It seems like all the major hearing aid apps work in a device-specific way, and
that's a shame. The goal here is to reverse engineer them to support a single
app.

Supported Devices:

- [ha-802](docs/ha-802.md)

## install

```
flutter run   # dev
flutter build # prod
```
